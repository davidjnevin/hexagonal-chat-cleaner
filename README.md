# Chat Cleaner

A web app to clean the Zoom chat generated *.txt files of speakers names and datetime details.

If do a lot of teaching using Zoom, you know that and after each class we save the chat and laboriously delete every second line to leave only the vocabulary shared during class.
With the desktop app I built [Zoom Chat Fixer](https://github.com/davidjnevin/zoom_chat_fixer) I solved the problem for myself.
This new version will be a web app and be built using hexagonal architecture and TDD.

The project is on going at the moment, and I'll share a link as soon as it's live.

I'll be using FastAPI and PostgreSQL for additonal features.
